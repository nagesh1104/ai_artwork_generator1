# AI Art Generator - Test Plan

## 1. Core Functionality Tests

### 1.1 Model Loading
- [x] Test loading the primary model (CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4)
- [x] Test loading the fallback model (runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5)
- [x] Test loading the tiny test model as a last resort

### 1.2 Image Generation
- [ ] Test generating an image with a simple prompt
- [ ] Test generating an image with a complex prompt
- [ ] Test generating an image with a very long prompt (edge case)
- [ ] Test generating an image with an empty prompt (edge case)

### 1.3 Image Editing
- [ ] Test editing an existing image with a new prompt
- [ ] Test editing a public image created by another user
- [ ] Test attempting to edit a private image created by another user (should fail)

## 2. User Authentication Tests

### 2.1 Registration
- [ ] Test user registration with valid credentials
- [ ] Test user registration with invalid email (edge case)
- [ ] Test user registration with a password that's too short (edge case)
- [ ] Test user registration with an existing username (edge case)

### 2.2 Login/Logout
- [ ] Test login with valid credentials
- [ ] Test login with invalid credentials (edge case)
- [ ] Test logout functionality

## 3. User Interface Tests

### 3.1 Navigation
- [ ] Test navigation between all pages
- [ ] Test responsive design on different screen sizes

### 3.2 Form Validation
- [ ] Test form validation for all input fields
- [ ] Test error messages for invalid inputs

## 4. Performance Tests

### 4.1 Load Testing
- [ ] Test application performance with multiple concurrent users
- [ ] Test image generation performance with different prompt complexities

### 4.2 Resource Usage
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during image generation
- [ ] Monitor CPU/GPU usage during image generation

## 5. Security Tests

### 5.1 Authentication
- [ ] Test access to protected pages without authentication
- [ ] Test session timeout and re-authentication

### 5.2 Input Validation
- [ ] Test for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Test for XSS vulnerabilities in user inputs

## 6. Error Handling Tests

### 6.1 Network Errors
- [x] Test application behavior when model download fails
- [ ] Test application behavior when the database connection fails

### 6.2 User Errors
- [ ] Test application behavior with invalid inputs
- [ ] Test error messages for clarity and helpfulness

## Test Results

### Completed Tests
- Model Loading: Successfully loaded the tiny test model after the main models timed out
- Database Connectivity: Successfully connected to the database and verified user records
- Error Handling: Successfully handled model download failures by using fallback models

### Known Issues
- Image generation with the tiny test model fails with a tensor size mismatch error
- Network timeouts when downloading the full models from Hugging Face

### Recommendations
1. Pre-download the models during application deployment to avoid runtime downloads
2. Implement a more robust error handling mechanism for image generation failures
3. Add more detailed error messages to help users understand and resolve issues
4. Consider using a smaller, more efficient model for faster generation and less resource usage
